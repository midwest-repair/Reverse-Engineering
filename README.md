### Replacement Parts

## About The Project

There's a lack of schmatics on consoles compared to the Apple industry likely due to the lower amount of revenue possible, but this project will help fill the gap. 
I plan on using this GitHub as centralized point of community feedback and contribution to help other board level repair shops get good information to save devices from the landfill. 

If you have infomation you'd like to share, just submit a Push Request to be reviewed and I'll be happy to merge it over. :)
