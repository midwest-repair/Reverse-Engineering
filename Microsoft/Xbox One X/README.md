# Xbox One X

In exprience of repairing X1X motherboards, I've accumulated many M1037358-002 motherboards (indicated by the numbers near the top right corner near the scorpion icon) so this will be the main mb version that will be reverse engineered. I've yet to find any real differences between the versions besides the main power rail having different mosfets.

### Inital Photos

* Removed all power rail coils
* Removed larger capacitors so the board sits flat on preheater
* Remove power supply connector as it's very tall and won't sit correctly on preheater

## Processing

The current process of setting up scanning for eventually getting a gerberfile

* Remove all componets from MB
* Send MB to a photographer that specializies in high DPI scanning for photos 
```
* I've reached out to many services, waiting till I get a response but should be pretty cheap
```
* Once delayering of all levels are scanned in, I've found a very specialized freelancer that will use Photoshop to our advantage to help starting with a basic board viewer 
```
more to follow
